//Explanation:
//The number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a number nn depends on the number of times 55 and 22 appear in its prime factors, as each pair of 2 and 5 contributes a trailing zero.
//Since there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials, the count of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 appears in the factorization.
//You continue dividing by higher powers of 5 until the quotient becomes zero. This approach efficiently counts the factors of 5 in n!.
